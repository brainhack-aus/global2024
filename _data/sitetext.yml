        convenes researchers from across the globe and myriad
        disciplines to work together on innovative projects related
        to neuroscience."
    - title: BrainHack Aus 2024

        The National Imaging Facility (NIF) provides open access to flagship imaging
        equipment, expertise, tools, data and analysis within Australia’s strategic
        science and research priorities. NIF has generously supplied funds,
        and staff time to help organise and promote the hackathon.

      description: >-
        Cognitive neuroscience investigates the biological processes that underlie human
        cognition. We strive to answer the question: How does the brain generate
        behaviour? To do so we combine behavioural methods with brain imaging techniques
        (such as functional MRI and electroencephalography), computational modelling,
        and artificial intelligence. The Cognitive Neuroscience Hub has generously organised
        the venue for this year's hackathon.

      description: >-
        The goal of the newly formed Australian Chapter is to unite and invigorate the
        neuroimaging community in Australia. Our members come from a variety of
        universities and research institutes around the country – Brisbane, Melbourne, 
        Sydney, Adelaide – working in the fields of fundamental and clinical neuroscience.
        We aim to further promote scientific communication and outreach through organising
        lectures, colloquia, workshops, conferences, and social/networking events throughout
        Australia. The OHBM Australian Chapter has helped with organisation and promotion
        of this year's Brain Hack, and its annual meeting will be colocated at the University of
        Melbourne in the days following the hackathon.
